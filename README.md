This project is a website for small teams to manage their work. Users can sign up and log in safely. Once in, they can create new tasks, give them details like a due date and importance, and see all their tasks. They can also give tasks to other team members. When a task is given to someone, that person gets a quick pop-up message right away so they know about it. There's also a main screen (dashboard) that shows what tasks you need to do, what tasks you've made, and any tasks that are late. You can also search for tasks or sort them to find what you need easily.
